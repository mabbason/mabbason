I’m a software engineer with experience developing serverless, resilient, and efficient<br/>
cloud applications who loves working with a team and learning new technologies.

I recently built [Seymour](https://seymour-active-monitoring.github.io/index.html), an open-source and easy-to-configure active monitoring<br/>
solution specializing in synthetic API testing.

I was born in Arizona, grew up all over California and Texas, married a<br/>
wonderful woman from New York and our family now lives in North Carolina.

Three truths and a lie:🤫<br/>1)  I have been a backhoe operator<br/> 
2)	I have been a professional ballet dancer 🩰<br/> 
3)	I have bush planed 🛩️ into remote Indonesia<br/> 
4)	I have pets named ‘PDF’ and ‘Dirty Bacon’

When I am not in the "code cave" I try my best to Dad so hard 🤘,<br/> 
stack correctly in a friendly game of ultimate, and go for<br/> 
long reads on the beach.

I have recently been trying to turn my thumb greener, keep our family’s<br/> 
host of pets (🐈🐕🐓🐠🐝) alive, and perfect my<br/>
“Ambient-Electro-Pirate-Metal” playlist.
